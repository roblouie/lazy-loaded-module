<h1>About</h1>

<p>This page was lazily loaded, but so was it's whole module, which can includes multiple components and services.
Services can be provided from the module and will be module scoped, unlike eagerly loaded modules where services
provided from the module are application scoped. Any service is still a singleton, it's just scoped to the module.</p>

<p>In addition to this page, a service has been loaded, as well as another page, because they were all part of
this page's module</p>

<p>Set a number here, it will be set in the service</p>
<input #setANumber type="number" (keyup)="setNumber(setANumber.value)">

<div>
  <a routerLink="subpage" routerLinkActive="active">Go to page two of the lazy loaded module</a>
</div>
